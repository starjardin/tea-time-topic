# Tea Time Topic

### Student report

1.   Stucture of my file. It is in one file, no module, when you reaload the file you should see the list alrady. There are some feature which are working and some feature are not yet finished. For instance the sorting by date is not finished, and when you add new topic it can't be updated nor deleted a bit of a night mare here.

1.   Improvements in the project, I think I would probably work on the date because it does not work now. I would seek why these new topics are not working.

1.   I think I improved with the local storage because it seems to be working now, Using event delegation seems to be ok now, not very struggling a lot.

1.   Wisdom to share: Focus on the challenge team. Take a break for a few mimutes if you really don't know what to do, then get back after a few minutes, it does help sometimes, more than anything else "don't give up"


Good luck team 🔥💪 and happy coding 👍
